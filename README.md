# In Silico Motor-Neuron-Perturbation
A quick notebook of in-silico perturbation of the developing motor neurons in the mouse spinal cord using crudely labelled cells.

Data and cell-type annotations were taken from the following publication: 
Julien Delile, Teresa Rayon, Manuela Melchionda, Amelia Edwards, James Briscoe, Andreas Sagner, Allon Klein, Barbara Treutlein; Single cell transcriptomics reveals spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression in the developing mouse spinal cord. Development 15 June 2019; 146 (12): dev173807. doi: https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.173807

scRNA-seq data was processed using Scanpy and GRN-perturbation was done using CellOracle
