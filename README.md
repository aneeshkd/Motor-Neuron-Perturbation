# Motor-Neuron-Perturbation
In-silico perturbation of the developing motor neurons in the mouse spinal cord 

Data and cell-type annotations were taken from the following publication: 
Julien Delile, Teresa Rayon, Manuela Melchionda, Amelia Edwards, James Briscoe, Andreas Sagner, Allon Klein, Barbara Treutlein; Single cell transcriptomics reveals spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression in the developing mouse spinal cord. Development 15 June 2019; 146 (12): dev173807. doi: https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.173807

scRNA-seq data was processed using Scanpy and GRN-perturbation was done using CellOracle

Result:
The in-silico knockout of Nf1a in the developing motor neurons of the mouse spinal cord shows a trajectory that inhibits the maturation of motor neurons.
